1. create int priority in struct proc from proc.h
2. allocproc will set priority to 0 (proc.c allocproc() function)
3. from exec.c add curproc->priority = 0; on line 102 -> so that process can have priority when it starts to execute maybe? idk...
4. create queue & MLFQ structure in queue.h & queue.c
	> TODO add queue related functions to "defs.h" for visibility.
5. implement sys_yield by followint the steps from lab03.
